                            victims. They become helpless as their crops, livestock's, homes and everything gets
                            affected. To help these people recover in long run, we look forward to your valuable
                            support. Thank you!

                        <p>As a part of our emergency response, we are working with different donors to collect recovery
                            fund including this project. All the funds collected for tackling the flood situation will
                            be channeled towards recovery of flood victims.</p>
